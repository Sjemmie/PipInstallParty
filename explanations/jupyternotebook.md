# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Variables

## Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks are interactive, web-based tools used for creating and sharing documents that combine live code, text, visualizations, and other multimedia. They are widely used in data analysis, machine learning, and academic research.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Coding**: Run code in small, manageable cells and view output immediately.
- **Documentation**: Combine executable code with rich, Markdown-based explanations.
- **Visualization**: Render graphs and plots inline using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
- **Language Support**: While primarily used for Python, Jupyter supports other languages like R, Julia, and JavaScript through kernels.

### Benefits:
- Ideal for exploratory data analysis.
- Facilitates collaborative work and reproducibility.
- Easy integration with version control systems like Git.

## Variables in Python
A **variable** is a container for storing data values. Variables are created when you assign a value to them, and they can hold various types of data such as numbers, text, or more complex objects. When running notebooks variables can be overwritten so keep this in mind when working with them. 

### Example:
```python
x = 10           # Integer
y = 3.14         # Float
name = "Alice"   # String
is_active = True # Boolean
