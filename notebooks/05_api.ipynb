The authentication process typically returns an access token that will be used in subsequent API calls.\n",

This involves sending a request (e.g., GET, POST) to the API endpoint with the necessary headers (e.g., Authorization) and parameters. The response is usually in JSON format, which can be parsed and used in your application.\n",

    "# API Methods: POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs typically support several HTTP methods to interact with resources. Here is an overview of the most commonly used methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **GET**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Retrieve data from the server.\n",
    "    - Characteristics: \n",
    "      - It is a read-only operation and does not modify any data on the server.\n",
    "      - Responses are typically in JSON or XML format.\n",
    "    - Example: Fetching a list of users or retrieving details of a specific resource.\n",
    "    - Safe and idempotent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **POST**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Create a new resource on the server.\n",
    "    - Characteristics:\n",
    "      - Sends data to the server in the request body.\n",
    "      - Often used for submitting forms or uploading files.\n",
    "    - Example: Creating a new user or adding a new record to a database.\n",
    "    - Not idempotent (repeating the request creates duplicate resources).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **PUT**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Update an existing resource or create a resource if it does not exist.\n",
    "    - Characteristics:\n",
    "      - Sends the complete updated data in the request body.\n",
    "      - Typically used for full updates.\n",
    "    - Example: Updating user details or replacing a file.\n",
    "    - Idempotent (repeating the request has the same effect as a single request).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **DELETE**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Remove a resource from the server.\n",
    "    - Characteristics:\n",
    "      - Deletes the specified resource.\n",
    "      - Often requires authentication or specific permissions.\n",
    "    - Example: Deleting a user or removing a file.\n",
    "    - Idempotent (repeating the request has the same effect as a single request).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **PATCH**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Partially update an existing resource.\n",
    "    - Characteristics:\n",
    "      - Sends only the fields to be updated in the request body.\n",
    "      - Typically used for partial updates.\n",
    "    - Example: Updating a user's email address without modifying other details.\n",
    "    - Not necessarily idempotent (depends on implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **HEAD**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Retrieve metadata about a resource without fetching the actual data.\n",
    "    - Characteristics:\n",
    "      - Similar to GET but does not return the response body.\n",
    "      - Useful for checking if a resource exists or retrieving headers.\n",
    "    - Example: Checking if a file exists on the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **OPTIONS**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Describe the communication options for the target resource.\n",
    "    - Characteristics:\n",
    "      - Returns the allowed HTTP methods for a resource.\n",
    "      - Useful for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) preflight requests.\n",
    "    - Example: Checking which methods are supported by an API endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **TRACE**:\n",
    "    - Purpose: Perform a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.\n",
    "    - Characteristics:\n",
    "      - Used for debugging purposes.\n",
    "      - Returns the request as received by the server.\n",
    "    - Example: Diagnosing issues with intermediate proxies or servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method serves a specific purpose and is used depending on the operation you want to perform on the resource. Understanding these methods is essential for designing and interacting with RESTful APIs effectively."
